You'll need to unzip the train and test files once they are downloaded. By default, the notebooks look for them in the ./data folder.
[Amazon Review Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews?select=train.csv)

## Elevator Pitch
Immediately after the title, write a very short description of the problem you are solving, the data you are using to solve it, and how well your model solves the problem
This should be no more than a couple of sentences

## Header Image
This image can be anything you want, so long as it is professional and aligns with your project
Ideal dimensions are 1280x640 pixels, but any image with landscape orientation (wider than it is tall) will work
Image sourcing ideas to consider:
Use a stock image from a source like Wikimedia Commons (Links to an external site.) or Unsplash (Links to an external site.)
Make sure you double-check the usage license and attribution requirements
Create visualizations with code (Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
Take your own photo
This is most relevant if you have a real-world connection to the domain
As a reminder, the Markdown notation for an image is ![alt text](path/to/image.png)



## Business Understanding

Explain the project context, using at least one citation to demonstrate your domain understanding
Consider including visualizations here as well

## Data Understanding




## Modeling and Evaluation
What kind of model(s) did you use?
How well did your final model perform, compared to the baseline?


## Conclusion

How would you recommend that your model be used?

## Repository Navigation
An explanation of the repository organization
