But Brita flow is different! It has a huge water tank capacity. That capacity makes it ideal for large families and small businesses.

The projector specs are a lie.

When I asked for a refund and return, they said my item nonrefundable since it was on sale. So now I'm stuck with this junk.

39,ProductReviews,Taotronics Active Noise Cancelling Headphone (SoundSurge 85) Review,"I had a chance to use Taotronics' Active Noise Cancelling Headphones for about a week and want to review this headphone. I will leave the link down below in case you are interested in buying after the review.

The main things that caught my attention about this headphone were ANC, USB C Type, Fast Charging, support AptX codec, and the price.

Pros:

\-Cheap: Got it for 40 dollars with coupon

\- ANC available

\-The sound resolution is quite impressive(I will be more specific down below)

\-Lots of base

\-Long battery life (I didn't need to charge for straight 5 days listening around 4hrs a day)

\-Fast Charging

\-Comfortable wear. (I wore this headphone for straight 4 hours but didn't feel any pain on my head or my ears. I think it's because they are over-ear type of headphone)

\-Strong Bluetooth connection (Didn't get disconnected for a week)

\-Light compare to the size

\-Decent time delay (It wasn't as responsive as AirPods, but there was less delay than QCYt1

Cons:

\-ANC works, but not as strong as more expensive products like bose and sony

currently, the ANC headphones out in the market are doing a great job canceling the low frequency, but the challenge is to block some of the high frequency from 1k to 3k hertz. The high-end ANC headphones usually covers up to 2k. But, I feel like this headphone cover up to around 1k which is a bit disappointing. But, it definitely blocks most of the low frequencies and looking at the price range it's quite surprising to have ANC feature in 40 dollars headphones.

\-High notes are pretty weak on this headphone. I believe this headphone is more base focused

\-Not able to play the next song

\-Most material used was plastic, except the banding part which is aluminum. (I was a bit disappointed by the material, but over time I noticed that the plastic build quality was pretty good, it didn't look like plastic)

Sound Tendency:

Base: Powerful but No distortion

Mid: The sound resolution was high and clear

High: When you get to high note, I felt like the resolution was low

Overview:

This headphone is for sure base oriented headphone and if you enjoy listening to pop, hip-hop, and EDM. It is definitely a go headphone. If you want to listen to classical music, especially piano, I would not recommend since the piano sound in high note was quite bad. I felt like there are some sense of distortion going on.

49,ProductReviews,Did Thymuskin hair-growth treatment give you acne?,"I have been using Thymuskin hair shampoo and serum (medium) for under a month.

&amp;#x200B;

The positive effects on the hair are noticeable, the hair already seems denser, shinier, and visibly regenerating. The perfume of the products is subtle and nice. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have a history of acne and I have been acne-free since I was 21. I am now in my early 30. So after not even a month of using these products, I have experienced a very aggressive acne eruption on my face, my back and my chest, like I haven't had since I was a teenager. I feel quite silly because I didn't think beforehand that this product, as it mimics the thymus gland, will have that effect on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish that the developers of these products had been more thorough, transparent and professional in testing their product than just saying that it has no side effects: I find it highly unlikely that I am the only one experiencing this.

I have a normal weight, I follow a plant-based diet, I don't take contraceptives, or any other medication, do HIIT trainings once every other day. The only thing new in my routine was Thymuskin :(

So I recommend it but only if you do not have a history of acne, as it will affect you pretty badly. 

What was your experience with this product or other hair-growth products?"

59,ProductReviews,“Comfy Kiddo” a reliable webshop?,"[Review]
I wanted to share my personal experience regarding a purchase from “Comfy Kiddo”. I landed on this website through a facebook ad, I liked the product (All-In-One Ergonomic Baby Carrier | 0-36 Months) but I wasn’t sure if this is a reliable seller or just another scam. So I tried to look up on internet , apparently no one ever heard about this brand “comfy kiddo”. If I look in the comment section in the facebook ad I see only positive comments (bit suspicious) and other people are just excited and waiting for their product to arrive. If I open their website everything looks genuine and professional but still I’m a bit skeptical why no one else has made a youtube review of their product or something like that, then again I thought maybe they are small business? And not so popular?

Still not so convinced about the authenticity of this webshop, but I like the product so much that I went ahead and ordered it, two weeks later my ‘comfy kiddo baby carrier’ arrives (which I wasn’t so sure about) but I immediately found out what happened. This baby carrier is not ‘comfy kiddo’ product but actually made by another company called “AIEBAO” and its 3x cheaper (plus free shipping). 

Bit disappointed but I like the product, only thing that I paid too much. I posted my comment on their facebook page:

“This is not a comfy kiddo product, this baby carrier is actually made by ‘Aiebao’ and its 3x cheaper in some stores (plus free shipping)”

3 hours later my comment is removed by their social media team and I am blocked from making any additional comments on their page. 

Has anyone else experienced something like that??
